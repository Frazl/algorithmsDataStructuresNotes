# Welcome

This is the place where I store all the Algorithms and Data Structures I'm currently learning in a simple and friendly python implementation. 

## What You'll Find 

### Algorithms

* Depth First Search
    * Depth First Paths

### Data Structures / Types

* Graph - Adjacent Lists 
* Priority Queue
* Queue
* Stack


### ToDo

#### Algorithms

* Add Binary Search
* Add Linear Search
* Add Quicksort
* Add Insertion Sort
* Add Selection Sort

#### Data Structures

* Finish learning graphs
* Finish learning hashmaps
* Add graph alterations (e.g. quicker integer only adjacent list graphs)
